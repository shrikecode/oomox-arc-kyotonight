#+title: Kyoto Night Arc Theme

Arc Theme based GTK theme, using Tokyo Night color palette. Created with Oomox GUI / Themix.

** Why?

GTK themes for Tokyo Night that float around are Oomox-based, which isn't exactly my taste. Although the
[[https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1681475][icons]] that come with it are wonderful.

** Features

This theme is generated from an old version of [[https://github.com/themix-project/themix-gui][Themix]] and is pretty rudimentary.
It lacks full Gnome Shell support, but should work great for GTK apps in general.

** Installation

Clone this repo to your themes directory:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/themes
git clone https://github.com/laniusone/oomox-arc-kyotonight.git ~/.local/share/themes/oomox-arc-kyotonight
#+end_src

I has some issues with themes when using i3, and I had to install them globally. To do that:

#+begin_src sh
sudo cp -r ~/.local/share/themes/oomox-arc-kyotonight /usr/share/themes/
#+end_src
